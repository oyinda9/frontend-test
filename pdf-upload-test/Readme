Hello ,my name is sholanke precious oyindamola and 

I've completed the PDF Signature Tool implementation with:

- PDF upload via drag-and-drop
- Canvas signature drawing
- PDF export with embedded signature
- Responsive design

Repository: https://github.com/oyinda9/frontend-test

cd pdf-upload-test
Install dependencies
pnpm install

# or

npm install
Run the development server
pnpm run dev
Open in browser

Libraries and Tools Used
Library/Tool Purpose Why Chosen
Next.js React framework Server-side rendering, excellent dev experience
pdf-lib PDF manipulation Client-side PDF editing capabilities
react-pdf PDF rendering Efficient PDF display in React
Tailwind CSS Styling Rapid UI development with utility classes
TypeScript Type checking Improved code quality and developer experience

Challenges and Solutions
Challenge: PDF.js worker loading issues
Solution: Implemented local worker loading with proper error handling

Challenge: Signature positioning in exported PDF
Solution: Used pdf-lib's coordinate system to precisely place signatures

Challenge: Canvas drawing performance
Solution: Optimized event handlers with useCallback and proper cleanup

Challenge: Mobile responsiveness
Solution: Implemented responsive design with Tailwind's breakpoints

Future Features (If I Had More Time)
